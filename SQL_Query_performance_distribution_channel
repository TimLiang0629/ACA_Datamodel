# The results from the distribution channel query will reveal which channels are generating the most sales and may benefit from increased marketing efforts. For instance, traditional distributors channel brings in a high volume of revenue, we could build on customer loyalty by offering more discount and special price. Conversely, online shopping is underperforming, we might consider online promotional events or special offers to boost sales through that channel.
