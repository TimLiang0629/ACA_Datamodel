# This query identifies the average quantity of each ingredient used across all batches and the corresponding average quality score of those batches. By focusing only on batches with a quality score at or above the overall average, we can understand which ingredient quantities contribute to high-quality beer. Furthermore, we can use this result to fine-tune our recipes to be both cost-effective and environmentally friendly while maintaining the premium quality that defines our brand. This strategic approach to ingredient management can lead to a more sustainable business model and reinforce our reputation for excellence in the craft beer market.
